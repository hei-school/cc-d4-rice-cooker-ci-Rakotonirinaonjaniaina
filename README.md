# Rice Cooker Project üçöüîå

## Description

This rice cooker project is developed using four different programming languages: C++, C, Ruby, Go. Each language implementation resides in a separate branch on GitHub, ensuring clearer code management and organization.

### Features

- Cooking rice
- Keep warm functionality
- Cooking schedule
- Quantity guide

## Installation üõ†Ô∏è

### C++

#### Prerequisites
Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed.

#### Installation
1. Switch to the C++ branch: `git checkout feature/cpp`
2. Compile the code: `g++ -o main main.cpp`

#### Linter
For C++ code quality checks, consider using [PVS-Studio](https://pvs-studio.com/fr/) for linting and code analysis.

#### Usage
To run the C++ program: `./main`

### C

#### Prerequisites
Ensure you have a C compiler installed.

#### Installation
1. Switch to the C branch: `git checkout feature/c`
2. Compile the code: `gcc -o main main.c`

#### Linter
Consider using [PVS-Studio](https://pvs-studio.com/fr/) for code analysis and linting in your C projects.

#### Usage
To run the C program: `./main`

### Ruby

#### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Ruby installed.

#### Installation and Usage
Switch to the Ruby branch: `git checkout feature/ruby` and run the Ruby program with: `ruby main.rb`

#### Linter
For Ruby code quality checks, explore linting and formatting tools like those mentioned [here](https://www.honeybadger.io/blog/linting-formatting-ruby/).

### Go

#### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Go installed.

#### Installation
1. Switch to the Go branch: `git checkout feature/go`
2. Build the code: `go build -o main.go`

#### Linter
Consider using tools like [go vet, gofmt, and golint](https://sparkbox.com/foundry/go_vet_gofmt_golint_to_code_check_in_Go) for linting and code consistency in your Go project.

#### Usage
To run the Go program: `./main.go`

Replace the file and command names with the actual ones from your project and provide specific details required for each language. These instructions should guide users through installing, compiling (if necessary), and running your rice cooker project in each language.

## How to Use üöÄ

1. **Start cooking**: Select the option to begin cooking rice.
2. **Keep warm**: Activate the keep warm functionality to maintain cooked rice temperature.
3. **Cooking schedule**: Set up a schedule for cooking rice at specific times.
4. **Quantity guide**: Access a guide for determining rice quantity and water ratio.

Make sure to provide any additional details or specifics relevant to your rice cooker functionalities within each language's implementation.
